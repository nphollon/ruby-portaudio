This package contains Ruby bindings to the PortAudio api. PortAudio is a cross-
platform interface to your audio hardware.

The ruby-portaudio package supports both PortAudio apis: blocking and
non-blocking. The blocking API allows Ruby scripts to iteratively fill a
sample buffer which is then written to the audio hardware (later versions will
also support reading from a buffer). The non-blocking api allows Ruby programs
to act as controllers for audio streams defined by an external callback
function. Because the callback function may be run in an interrupt, it is not
really feasible to implement one in Ruby. You can, however, write your callback
function in a C extension, or you may build your own using LLVM or LibJIT as in
http://github.com/jvoorhis/Motivik.

See the bottom of lib/portaudio.rb for an example.

== Requirements
* PortAudio, version 1.9 or better
* Fairly complete support for Ruby's foreign function interface
