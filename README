This is a branch of Jeremy Voorhis's ruby-portaudio. The original README is located at README_original.

WARNING: This code is undergoing a major refactoring. If a feature does not have specifications in spec/, you should not expect it to work.

Let me know if you want to help improve the code. If you are looking for a fully functional realtime audio module, for now you should check out the original branch at voorhis/ruby-portaudio.
