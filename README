This is a Ruby interface to the PortAudio API.

This is a work in progress. Stream input is not yet supported. Callback functions are not yet supported. For an example of how the library can be used, see tryit.rb.

--Requirements--

* Ruby v1.9.3 or higher
* PortAudio
* RubyInline

* RSpec is required to run the test suite.

--Notes on Portability--

For the code to work on your machine, you must tell RubyInline the location of libportaudio.a and the libraries for your platform-specific APIs. To do this, edit the "builder.add_link_flags" line at the top of lib/portaudio_func.rb.

The RSpec tests are specific to my own computer. Do not expect them all to pass.

--To Do--

(a non-exhaustive list)
* Implement callback functions
* Implement reading from stream
* Increase portability
* Test on multiple platforms
* File I/O?
* Create a gem (someday...)
